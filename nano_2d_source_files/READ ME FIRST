READ ME FIRST

By Eric Groszman, Sun K Choi, and Yunong Xu

This folder contains a number of MATLAB files. Before running, please make sure that the path for this folder is added to MATLAB.

Instructions for running true data tests are in the very bottom of this README doc.

Below are descriptions for each file in this folder:

nano_2d_main.m 
	- main file for running the model
	- here, one specifies the grid size and test number
	- contains important subfunctions, including main method (see below)
	
	subfunctions:
	grid2d
		- LP model (main method)
	nanoDraw
		- for visualization of true vs. predicted solutions
	mantexpnt 
		- for optional visualization parameter to display the model error in the figure title

nano_2d_testcases.m
	contains 10 test cases to enable easier testing of model
	the test case number is set by the user in nano_2d_main.m

test_script_source_loc.m
	- main function for real data tests
	- displays the b vector for the data files of interest

sensor_strength
	- constructs the b (signal strength) vector from fitted data
	- called by test_script_source_loc.m

fit_data.m
	- fits sensor data
	- called by sensor_strength.m

build_data_mat
	- loads and cleans up raw data and stores it in a matrix format
	- called by sensor_strength.m

data (folder)
	- raw data for real data tests gathered with MRXII (.mat files)
	- data is point source signals at all possible positions of a 9 x 9 grid
	- the script that loads the data (build_datamat) takes care of changing the path to access these files

--- real data instructions ---

	--> when testing real data, run test_script_source_loc.m for desired
		dataset
	--> copy the displayed b vector from the command window
	--> paste the b vector after the b vector is constructed in grid2d 
		(to overwrite the b vector)
	--> choose desired N value in nano_2d_main
	--> run
