that the transverse relaxivity r2, the parameter representing the MRI
efficiency in negative contrast agents, for the PVA-coated, PEGF-coated, and
crosslinked PEGF-coated CNCs, is high enough to contrast suitably the
magnetic resonance images. The same samples have shown a good ability also
in drug releasing (particularly the crosslinked PEGF-coated compound), thus
finally allowing us to propose this class of compounds for future
applications in theranostics.},

of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) active nanoparticles, which target
folate receptor overexpressing tumor cells. Self-assembled nanoparticles
with a hydrodynamic size of 50-200 nm were prepared from
poly-$\gamma$-glutamic acid and chitosan biopolymers with Gd-ions. The
nanoparticles are biocompatible, non-toxic and stable for several months in
aqueous media. In vitro assays using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and
MR imaging on HeLa human cervix carcinoma tumor cells showed that folic acid
targeted nanoparticles were internalized specifically in a folate receptor
dependent manner. In vivo study confirmed, that, considerable accumulation
of nanosystems was found compared with the control animal represented by the
MR images. Relaxometry measurements demonstrated that the nanoparticle-Gd
complexes drastically change the signal intensity of the tumor cells.
Because of the contrast enhancement, they are attractive candidates as

abstract = {We report a facile approach to synthesizing
3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTS)-coated magnetic iron oxide
(Fe(3)O(4)@APTS) nanoparticles (NPs) with tunable surface functional groups
for potential biomedical applications. The Fe(3)O(4) NPs with a mean
diameter of 6.5 nm were synthesized by a hydrothermal route in the presence
of APTS. The formed amine-surfaced Fe(3)O(4)@APTS NPs were further
chemically modified with acetic anhydride and succinic anhydride to generate
neutral (Fe(3)O(4)@APTS⋅Ac) and negatively charged (Fe(3)O(4)@APTS⋅SAH) NPs.
These differently functionalized NPs were extensively characterized by x-ray
diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy, thermogravimetry analysis, zeta potential measurements, and
T(2) relaxometry. The cytotoxicity of the particles was evaluated by in
vitro 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
colorimetric viability assay of cells along with microscopic observation of
cell morphology. The hemocompatibility of the particles was assessed by in
vitro hemolysis assay. We show that the hydrothermal approach enables an
efficient modification of APTS onto the Fe(3)O(4) NP surfaces and the formed
NPs with different surface charge polarities are water-dispersible and
colloidally stable. The acetylated Fe(3)O(4)@APTS⋅Ac NPs displayed good
biocompatibility and hemocompatibility in the concentration range of
0-100 µg ml(-1), while the pristine Fe(3)O(4)@APTS and Fe(3)O(4)@APTS⋅SAH
particles started to display slight cytotoxicity at a concentration of
10 µg ml(-1). The findings from this study suggest that the Fe(3)O(4)@APTS
NPs synthesized by the one-pot hydrothermal route can be surface modified
for various potential biomedical applications.},

@article{Hathaway2011,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer detection using mammography has
improved clinical outcomes for many women, because mammography can detect
very small (5 mm) tumors early in the course of the disease. However,
mammography fails to detect 10 - 25\% of tumors, and the results do not
distinguish benign and malignant tumors. Reducing the false positive rate,
even by a modest 10\%, while improving the sensitivity, will lead to
improved screening, and is a desirable and attainable goal. The emerging
application of magnetic relaxometry, in particular using superconducting
quantum interference device (SQUID) sensors, is fast and potentially more
specific than mammography because it is designed to detect tumor-targeted
iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles. Furthermore, magnetic relaxometry is
theoretically more specific than MRI detection, because only target-bound
nanoparticles are detected. Our group is developing antibody-conjugated
magnetic nanoparticles targeted to breast cancer cells that can be detected
using magnetic relaxometry.

METHODS: To accomplish this, we identified a series of breast cancer cell
lines expressing varying levels of the plasma membrane-expressed human
epidermal growth factor-like receptor 2 (Her2) by flow cytometry. Anti-Her2
antibody was then conjugated to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles
using the carbodiimide method. Labeled nanoparticles were incubated with
breast cancer cell lines and visualized by confocal microscopy, Prussian
blue histochemistry, and magnetic relaxometry.

RESULTS: We demonstrated a time- and antigen concentration-dependent
increase in the number of antibody-conjugated nanoparticles bound to cells.
Next, anti Her2-conjugated nanoparticles injected into highly
Her2-expressing tumor xenograft explants yielded a significantly higher
SQUID relaxometry signal relative to unconjugated nanoparticles. Finally,
labeled cells introduced into breast phantoms were measured by magnetic
relaxometry, and as few as 1 million labeled cells were detected at a
distance of 4.5 cm using our early prototype system.

CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the antibody-conjugated magnetic
nanoparticles are promising reagents to apply to in vivo breast tumor cell
detection, and that SQUID-detected magnetic relaxometry is a viable, rapid,
and highly sensitive method for in vitro nanoparticle development and
eventual in vivo tumor detection.},

@article{Adolphi2010,
abstract = {Optimizing the sensitivity of SQUID (superconducting quantum
interference device) relaxometry for detecting cell-targeted magnetic
nanoparticles for in vivo diagnostics requires nanoparticles with a narrow
particle size distribution to ensure that the N\'{e}el relaxation times fall
within the measurement timescale (50 ms-2 s, in this work). To determine the
optimum particle size, single-core magnetite nanoparticles (with nominal
average diameters 20, 25, 30 and 35 nm) were characterized by SQUID
relaxometry, transmission electron microscopy, SQUID susceptometry, dynamic
light scattering and zeta potential analysis. The SQUID relaxometry signal
(detected magnetic moment/kg) from both the 25 nm and 30 nm particles was an
improvement over previously studied multi-core particles. However, the
detected moments were an order of magnitude lower than predicted based on a
simple model that takes into account the measured size distributions (but
neglects dipolar interactions and polydispersity of the anisotropy energy
density), indicating that improved control of several different nanoparticle
properties (size, shape and coating thickness) will be required to achieve
the highest detection sensitivity. Antibody conjugation and cell incubation
experiments show that single-core particles enable a higher detected moment
per cell, but also demonstrate the need for improved surface treatments to
mitigate aggregation and improve specificity.},
