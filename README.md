Naming Conventions
------------------

following - `http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK/Coding_Style_Guide#Naming_Conventions`

 * Names are constructed by using case change to indicate separate words, as in TimeStamp (versus Time Stamp).
 * Underscores are not used.
 * Variable names are chosen carefully with the intention to convey the meaning behind the code.
 * Names are generally spelled out
 * Use of abbreviations is discouraged. (Abbreviation are allowable when in common use, and should be in uppercase as in RGB.) While this does result in long names, it self-documents the code.
 * If you learn how to use name completion in your editor (e.g.,Vim, Emacs), this inconvenience can be minimized.
